Learn Software Engineering using C# (The Hard Way)
===================================

I am a big fan of the project 'Learn Python the hard way' (http://learnpythonthehardway.org/). 

In a world of 'Learn X in 24 hours' and 'Lose weight without exercising and eating anything you want', it's a breath of fresh air. It recognizes that there are no shortcuts for any goal which is worth achiving. You must put in sincere and dedicated effort to achieve the goal.

I started learning programming in summer of 1995 and was hooked to it right away. Since then, I have written lots of code, commited tons of mistakes and learned few things (there is so much more to know!). In 2002, I learned about Joel Spolsky and started reading his articles on software development. It made me realize that I am not the hotshot programmer that I think I am. It was at that point, I decided to put in work to improve my knowledge about software development. Thanks to him, I learned about Eric Sink who taught me the difference between a programmer and a developer (http://ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html). (Yes, that's where I still my bio line from! http://solutionyogi.com/about.htm) Around 2005, I came across Eric Lippert's blog and once again I realized how little I know. Thankfuly, he is an amazing writer and teacher and I learnt an awful lot about software development through his blog. 

Since last few years, I realized that I enjoy teaching topics related to software development. It brings me tremendous joy when I see the 'aha' moment on someones face when I teach them something. 

The goal of this repository is to come up with material (notes/examples/exercises) which anyone can use to learn how to develop software using C#. 

Exercises:

1. CsvReader

2. CsvToSqlInsert 

Go to respective folder to get full detail on the exercise.
